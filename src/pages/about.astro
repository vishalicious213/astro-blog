        <p>Building out an Astro site to learn its flow. Then, I'll go through the SSG process & learn how to render server-side generated content. Then, I'll see how to do it with WordPress as a backend.</p>
        <p>With those in place, I can generate headless SSG WP websites, with regard to pages & blog posts. Then, I'll figure out WooCommerce & we'll have  viable option for freelancing with static sites, blog sites & ecommerce sites.</p>
